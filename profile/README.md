### Principles We Live By

* Ask for forgiveness, not permission[^1].
* Suprise no one. Explanation: [No surprises explainer video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMNxTDNf2/).
* Keep LeCollab clean (don’t let tasks stay open for too long).
* Steadily add value, do not only respond to change requests.
* When leaving messages, be specific: who, what, when. Do never let this be unclear to customer or teammate
* Always leave things you used in same or better condition than found. This works for: tasks, documents, code, website, etc... as much as for desks, chairs, kitchen, glasses or toilet.
* Keep in mind broken theory window!
* Give feedback to your collegue when you notice it is needed. Don't be withrawn, sarcastic, or defensive.
* Do not confront/attack. Express concernes and ask for estimates/suggestions.
* Be kind.
* Even if asked for advice or opinion, you might not be the person that should answer. Listen and ask.
* Blame is not for failing, it is for not asking for help.
* Be open about mistakes and errors you cause. To your team and to our customers.
* Do not be passive in customer collaboration, consider every customers business a productive partnership.
* **Compliment the effort, not the result.** (Result is perfect only because of the effort).
* Avoid triangulation whenever possible (talk to the person directly instead of going to other person/boss).
