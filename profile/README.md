### Our Open Source Solutions

StuntCoders is committed to contributing to the open source ecosystem. Our open source projects are inspired by recurring needs of our own and our customers:

* [Deployer](https://github.com/stuntcoders/stunt_deployer_server) a minimal JavaScript server that makes it easy for you to deploy to your staging or production servers, with tools that you regularly use  — on demand. The server works well with all popular services, such as Capistrano, Fabric, bash, Ansible, or Kubernetes.

* [Pre-commit hooks for Magento development](https://github.com/stuntcoders/stunt_mage_pre_commit_hooks), a collection of pre-commit hooks for Magento development checking PHP and JS files, as well as commit messages.


### Our Best Practices
In order to regularly perform at the highest level possible, we have recognized a need for standardizing our methods and tools. That’s why we make our best practices available to the community. This way, engineers all over the world can take advantage of our ten years of experience tackling some of the most challenging issues on the web.

* [Writing good commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages)
* [Rules for keeping a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
* [Install and use pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/)
* [Use Git Flow branching model across team and projects](https://vimeo.com/16018419)

### Principles We Live By

* Ask for forgiveness, not permission[^1].
* Surprise no one. Explanation: [No surprises explainer video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMNxTDNf2/).
* Keep LeCollab clean (don’t let tasks stay open for too long).
* Steadily add value, do not only respond to change requests.
* When leaving messages, be specific: who, what, when. Do never let this be unclear to customer or teammate
* Always leave things you used in the same or better condition than found. This works for: tasks, documents, code, website, etc... as much as for desks, chairs, kitchen, glasses or toilet.
* Keep the broken window theory in mind!
* Give feedback to your colleague when you notice it is needed. Don't be withdrawn, sarcastic, or defensive.
* Do not confront/attack. Express concerns and ask for estimates/suggestions.
* Be kind.
* Even if asked for advice or opinion, you might not be the person that should answer. Listen and ask.
* Blame is not for failing, it is for not asking for help.
* Be open about mistakes and errors you cause. To your team and to our customers.
* Do not be passive in customer collaboration, consider every customer's business a productive partnership.
* **Compliment the effort, not the result.** (Result is perfect only because of the effort).
* Avoid triangulation whenever possible (talk to the person directly instead of going to another person/boss).
